            "title": "Fully Subsidized COBRA",
            "content": ". Yesterday Democrats revealed their plan to keep some of the millions of workers laid off as a result of the COVID-19 economic shutdown insured: fully subsidize the premiums of COBRA eligible workers. COBRA is the government insurance program that allows laid-off former employees to stay on their employer-based insurance while subsidizing a portion of the premiums. And while the full premium subsidy will be of great assistance to many newly unemployed workers, it is a grossly inadequate policy response to the problem at hand. . The urgent public health need in the midst of a pandemic is to remove cost as a barrier for receiving medical care so that infected individuals are not discouraged from receiving necessary medical treatment. This plan fails badly for two reasons: . COBRA is not a universal benefit. To be eligible you must have been on an employer-based plan before being laid off. Many of the newly laid-off workers, particularly from the hard-hit restaurant and retail sectors, were not covered by their former employers and are not eligible for COBRA as a result. And it does nothing for those unemployed before the crisis. | Neither COBRA nor the expanded COBRA cover all medical costs. In particular, deductibles and co-pays are still the responsibility of the policyholder. These represent serious cost barriers, especially for the newly unemployed, and may discourage people from seeking out necessary care. | . Making the proposed policy even more objectionable is that it represents a huge taxpayer give-away to a rapacious private insurance industry that, despite continued strong profits, are already planning to use the coronavirus as an excuse to jack up premiums in 2021. . Sadly, this proposal contains many hallmarks of Democratic policy since the Clinton administration. It is an inadequate response to the problem at hand. It depends on complicated eligibility and financing mechanisms that make it both less effective and more difficult for the end user. And it uses public funds to pay politically connected private interests to accomplish, poorly but at great profit, a public function. . Unfortunately, the powers that be in the Democratic party view these faults as features. Until control of the party is wrested away from the Pelosis and Schumers of this world the Democratic party will continue to forward these inadequate, neoliberal, corporate giveaways as the best possible policy. But hey, they can always campaign on the fact that they aren&#39;t Republicans. .",

            "content": ". David Dayen has an incredible scoop today regarding the 1,200 USD CARES Act stimulus checks. The purpose of these checks is to give all adult Americans a one-time payment to pay for essentials during the economic shutdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. And while the amount and one-time nature of the payment is inadequate for the task, it was one of the few features of the bill that was directly targeted at helping average Americans pay their bills. Or so we thought. . Incredibly, Treasury officials have given financial institutions explicit permission to seize these funds - which are to be directly deposited by the IRS into taxpayers bank accounts - to pay off existing debts. These include delinquent loans and past due fees - even on accounts that are already closed. . It&#39;s hard to imagine a more explicit, and terrifying statement of the government&#39;s priorities in the unfolding crisis. By all means put some food on the table and keep the lights on. But only once the financial industry gets its taste. . As Hamilton Nolan poignantly wrote last week, the plan is to save capital and let you die. .",

            "content": ". At Vox Patrick Sharkey examines county-level geolocation data and finds that the two strongest predictors of poor social distancing scores during the COVID-19 pandemic are Donald Trump&#39;s vote share and climate change denial. . . It should surprise no one aware of Fox News&#39; response to the pandemic that this is the case. The line from Bullshit Mountain throughout March was that the coronavirus was a Democratic conspiracy to destroy Donald Trump. Only once the bodies started piling up in April did Fox grudgingly admit that, yes, America was in the midst of a pandemic. So egregious was Fox&#39;s misinformation that multiple lawsuits charging Fox with recklessly endangering American citizens are now working their way through the courts. . This is a particularly poignant example of what David Roberts rightly calls America&#39;s epistemic crisis. There are two separate partisan truths in America. One relies on traditional sources of evidence and authority such as science, reason, and the observation of the physical world. The other is mostly fabricated and exists solely to further the political project of the Republican Party. If traditional sources of evidence conflict with this second truth, they are vilified as tools of a sinister liberal elite seeking to hoodwink the American people. The paradigmatic example of this dynamic in action is the American right&#39;s nearly unique denial of climate science. . For the most part, this second truth is used to push a policy platform that is against the interests of a huge majority of its supporters. And while the GOP policy platform has profound, life-threatening implications (e.g. not expanding Medicaid with the Affordable Care Act) it&#39;s insidious nature is diffuse and effectively hidden by the same propaganda machine that so effectively advocates for it. . But COVID-19 is not diffuse and not hidden. More than 10,000 people have now died in the NYC metro area and most of the country is locked down. The evidence that a once a century pandemic is going on is unavoidable. And still millions of Americans persist in believing and behaving in ways that belie that basic, physical reality. Unfortunately, viruses do not care about politics and they will suffer for it, and soon. As this graphic demonstrating the differing course of the virus in sister states Kentucky (Democratic governor took strong measures) and Tennessee (GOP governor did nothing until late March) shows, they already are: . .",

            "title": "Socialize Pharma",
            "content": ". At Jacobin, Leigh Phillips uses some rare good news in the fight against antibiotic resistance as a jumping-off point to advocate for socializing the pharmaceutical industry. And while he lays out the basic case for doing so well, he misses the fundamental absurdity of our current financing system for drug discovery. The case for socializing pharma becomes all the stronger once our current system of publicly funded biomedical research and government-granted patents is taken into account. . The argument for socializing drug discovery and production is straight forward. Pharmaceutical companies earn the most profit from drugs that patients have to take every day for an indeterminate period - mostly to manage chronic conditions like high cholesterol, hypertension, and diabetes. Drugs that are needed infrequently and for a short period (e.g. antibiotics) or drugs that cure or prevent a disease (e.g. vaccines) are not as profitable. As a result, pharmaceutical companies expend endless resources on developing new drugs for diseases for which effective treatments already exist while completely ignoring entire classes of drugs for which there is a desperate need for new therapies. As Phillips points out this isn&#39;t so much a failing of pharmaceutical companies themselves as a systematic failure of capitalism. Because the capitalist measure of value, profit, does not account for actual human need we are left with the absurd situation of billions being spent on developing new statins while facing the very real possibility of not having effective antibiotics. The simplest solution is to remove the profit incentive, socialize the discovery and production of drugs (preferably internationally), and direct it towards fulfilling real human needs. . This is especially true when one considers the extent to which the pharmaceutical industry is already subsidized by the American taxpayer. As Phillips points out, most (if not all) of the basic research that results in novel therapies are carried out in university labs and funded primarily by public grants via the National Institutes of Health (NIH). These grants, about 40 billion, account for more than a third of total pharmaceutical research. The real give away though, as Dean Baker so rightfully and regularly points out, is the government-granted patent protections for new drugs. These patents allow pharmaceutical companies to sell drugs for several hundred to several thousands of times the cost of production and drive a majority of their 440+ billion (2.2% of GDP in 2018) revenue per year. Baker estimates that if the government simply directly paid the entire costs of research upfront and sold the drugs at the cost of production the savings to patients would be on the order of 400 billion annually! . Socializing pharma would not only redirect drug discovery towards fulfilling crucial medical needs but it would massively improve the affordability and access to medicines. It is a no brainer and should be part of any Left plan to reform our broken health care system. .",

            "title": "The Goldfinch",
            "content": ". I read Donna Tartt&#39;s brilliant 2013 novel The Goldfinch 6 years late and was mesmerized. The immediate impression I had was one of pleasure, the deep satisfaction of witnessing another human being achieve mastery in their craft. As a lifelong football fan, I viscerally felt this description of another slate of 4 PM kickoffs winding down: . On game day, until five o’clock or so, the white desert light held off the essential Sunday gloom—autumn sinking into winter, loneliness of October dusk with school the next day—but there was always a long still moment toward the end of those football afternoons where the mood of the crowd turned and everything grew desolate and uncertain, onscreen and off, the sheet-metal glare off the patio glass fading to gold and then gray, long shadows and night falling into desert stillness, a sadness I couldn’t shake off, a sense of silent people filing toward the stadium exits and cold rain falling in college towns back east. . Tartt is a gifted writer who spent 11 years on The Goldfinch and it shows. . Beyond the beautiful prose, the book is full of profound meditations on the relation of art and mortality; the experience of trauma, substance abuse, and ennui; the liminal state of participating in a social strata to which one can never be fully accepted; and how the love of the idea of a person can be impervious to their reality. And of course, Boris, the most gloriously original fictional character I&#39;ve encountered in some time. . I was excited then to get online and read what others thought of it. I was aware - it was on the front material of my digital copy - that the book had won the 2014 Pulitzer Prize and so expected a cavalcade of praise. Instead I was dismayed by the critical firestorm that the book had engendered upon its release. The criticism of The Goldfinch wasn&#39;t so much about the novel itself as it was about what the critics perceived the novel was claiming to be. In their minds The Goldfinch presented itself as literature which they decided it was most decidedly not. That, in fact, by being widely read and acclaimed as such The Goldfinch was doing the entire idea of literature a grave disservice. . This sort of critique was exemplified by James Wood in the New Yorker. Wood did not like the book. He thought it&#39;s prose and themes childish (how this can be the case when one of the major threads of the novel is substance abuse and dependence is beyond me, but I digress), it&#39;s characters out of central casting from a fairy tale, and it&#39;s narrative too fantastic to be engaging. Worst of all for Wood, The Goldfinch claims to be something that it is decidedly not: . Tartt’s consoling message, blared in the book’s final pages, is that what will survive of us is great art, but this seems an anxious compensation, as if Tartt were unconsciously acknowledging that the 2013 “Goldfinch” may not survive the way the 1654 “Goldfinch” has. . This is not a criticism of the book on its merits. It is a criticism of what Woods perceives to be the authors intent. The book is not only bad, it is especially bad because Wood claims that Tartt intends it as literature. . There are two levels on which this bothers me. First, it implies that trying and failing to create literature is somehow worthy of special disapproval. That the mere thought of attaining greatness opens one up for exceptional criticism. Second, it further implies the existence of a sanctified group of people with unique ability to judge whether a book is great or merely tries to be great. People like James Wood. . Why would a critic, who one assumes loves literature, seek to discourage people from attempting to write literature? Why is a book especially bad because it attempts and fails to be great? If anything such an attempt should be recognized and bemoaned as a misfortune, a writer as obviously talented as Tartt encouraged to try again. It&#39;s almost as if some critics are more jealous of their prerogative then they are devoted to their canon. But that would be judging critics on our perceptions of their intent, and that would be unfair wouldn&#39;t it? . Fortunately for you, dear reader, Wood is wrong on the merits of Tartt&#39;s novel. The Goldfinch is a brilliant book and you should read it. .",

            "content": ". On April 6, 2020 John Roberts sentenced an unknown number of Wisconsinites to their deaths. In a 5-4 decision, the Republican Supreme Court majority ruled that absentee ballots for the April 7 Wisconsin primary - in which a critical state Supreme Court seat was up for election - would only be counted if they were postmarked by that date. This despite two inconvenient facts: . Hundreds of thousands of the 1.2M voters who requested absentee ballots were not expected to have received them by April 7. | Like the rest of the United States, Wisconsin is beset by a pandemic caused by a highly contagious, airborne coronavirus. | . As a result of this decision, Wisconsinites were faced with a grim choice the next day: dramatically increase their chance of infection (and further community spread) by venturing out into public to cast their vote or stay home and accept their disenfranchisement. Perhaps shocked by their depravity in creating this dilemma, the right-wing ideologues on the Court left their opinion unsigned. . This episode is disturbing in of itself - the Republican Party, for narrow partisan advantage, engineered a situation where voters had to chose between their safety and their franchise. But the reason it is the subject of my inaugural blog is it is illustrative of three of the worst pathologies of the modern GOP: . Power as the ultimate end in itself. The Court made this ruling because it made it more likely that the GOP would retain a majority on the Wisconsin State Supreme Court. That majority in turn will rule in ways to further GOP minority rule in one of the most gerrymandered states in American history. This circular logic of power as both a means and an end in itself is fundamental to the conservative psyche. | The centrality of voter suppression to the GOP electoral strategy. Due to the deep unpopularity of their agenda and the changing demographic profile of the country, the GOP recognizes that they cannot win free and fair elections. To compete electorally, they must systematically suppress the vote of likely Democratic voters (minorities, urbanites, the young). This is a particular obsession of Chief Justice John Roberts, who somehow maintains a positive approval rating amongst Democrats while systematically working to undermine their ability to vote. | Extremism. Not even the physical safety of fellow citizens is worth protecting in pursuit of partisan advantage. | . These themes will recur regularly as the American political system descends further into chaos and dysfunction. . Postscript (4-14-2020): In spite of the GOP&#39;s grossly irresponsible effort to suppress the vote, Democrat Jill Kaforsky won the race for the Wisconsin Supreme Court. The blood of the Wisconsinites who contracted COVID-19 while voting remains on the GOP&#39;s hands. .",
